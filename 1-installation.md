# Multi-Node Cluster Installation Lab

The purpose of this lab is to install a complete IBM Cloud Private cluster running on multiple nodes.

> **Note** : you should have defined 4 (virtual) machines (RHEL version 7.8) and collected IP addresses and root passwords for these machines.



---


# Task 1: Prerequisites

Before you start installing IBM Cloud Private, you must provision a set of four machines using your favorite vitualization tools or on your prefered cloud infrastructure :
- One master node (including boot node, management node, va node, proxy node) : 16 vCores, 32 GB (RAM), 300 GB (Storage), one IP
- Three worker nodes:  4  vCores, 8 GB (RAM), 100 GB (Storage), one IP per worker
- All nodes are running RHEL version 7.8
- ICP Enterprise Edition - version 3.2.1.2008 will installed during this lab.

Concerning NFS, in that case,  we will install the NFS server later in the Master node (see a specific lab for this).

![image-20190514161953536](images/image-20190514161953536-7843593.png)



Let's say that we have a **prefix hostname** (**nicekkk** in my example). Then each node will get a complementary character or string at the end :
- m01 : example - nicekkkm01 for the master node (and all the other nodes included - see above)
- w01 or w02 or w03 : for example - nicexkkkw01,  nicexkkkw02 and nicekkkw03 for the worker nodes
- The NFS node name is not involved at this point and it will be located on the master
- 

A list of Master VMs will be given to you during the workshop.

Please pick one Master VM and write your name on the right part of the document.

![image-20201011211310267](images/image-20201011211310267-2443590.png)

You only need to know the Master Node VM to work on the labs.

The name of each VM follows the following conventions:

- all VMs start with **nice**
- **3 letters** to make the cluster unique (kkk in my example)
- the type of node : **m** for master and **w** for worker
- and finally, 2 digits like **01**, 02 ...

So, your list of VMs could be for example:

- niceparm01
- niceparw01
- niceparw02
- niceparw03

The prefix and the cluster name are the same value and this name is specified in the document for each participant.  The suffix is always '.ibm.ws'. 

There are 2 passwords : one to ssh to the master node VM and the other to access the cluster. This second value is accessible thru `echo $CLUSTERPASS`

> **Please don't change the given prefix name, cluster name, cluster password and suffix name.**

All machines should be **up** and **running**. 

They also must be **accessible** to each other thru their IPs. 

Everything has been made with automation in mind. 



# Task 2: Step by step configuration

### Step 1: Login to the master machine

You must use <u>ssh</u> or <u>putty</u> to the **master node**.

**Login to your master** node by using the following command (change with you master IP address) :

```bash
ssh root@<masterip>
```

Where the <masterip> is the ip address of your master (this has been given by the instructor)

You will stay on the Master node during all the labs.

### Step 2: Setup the credentials for all machines

We have decided to automate most of the installation by setting **variables**.

Normally you need to type all IPs and root passwords in a list of variables like the one below:

```bash
export M1N=
export M1IP=
export M1PW=
export W1N=
export W1IP=
export W1PW=
export W2N=
export W2IP=
export W2PW=
export W3N=
export W3IP=
export W3PW=
export PREFIX=
export CLUSTERNAME=
export CLUSTERPASS=
export SUFFIX=.ibm.ws
```

**We have already prepared files containing these variables for you.** All variables are set thru .bashrc or in the icpinit files. 

Look at the the following file **icpinit**:

```bash
more icpinit
```

Results:

```bash
export M1N=niceehnbm01
export M1IP=158.176.122.50
export M1PW=Hy28n7aC
export W1N=niceehnbw01
export W1IP=158.176.122.11
export W1PW=DTs42t8a
export W2N=niceehnbw02
export W2IP=158.176.83.198
export W2PW=D9xc5yvd
export W3N=niceehnbw03
export W3IP=158.176.122.38
export W3PW=AK2xVbj8
export PREFIX=nicekkk
export CLUSTERNAME=nicekkk
export CLUSTERPASS=admin1!
export SUFFIX=.ibm.ws
```

Check that all the variables have a value.

Alternatively, type a command like: 

`echo $M1IP`

Results (as an example):

```bash
# echo $M1IP
158.176.128.214
```

> **Don't change the values or the variable names**.
>
> All the steps and most labs are using these variables.

If you don't see any settings for your variables, please source the icpinit:

``` bash
source icpinit
```

Then retry to echo the $M1IP.



###Step 3: Create a credential file for all your nodes

We need to create a credential file for some next steps (to distribute automaticaly all keys and /etc/hosts to all nodes). 

Please **copy, paste and execute** the following commands in the master terminal:

```bash
cd /root/.ssh
cat <<END > credentials
root:$W1PW@$W1IP
root:$W2PW@$W2IP
root:$W3PW@$W3IP
END
```

Check the output with the following command :

```bash
more credentials
```

Results (as an example):

```bash
# more credentials 
root:DTs42t8a@158.176.122.11
root:D9xc5yvd@158.176.83.198
root:AK2xVbj8@158.176.122.38
```

###Step 4: Configure the /etc/hosts

We now need to create an **/etc/hosts** file for all nodes. **Execute** the following commands:

```bash
cd /root
cat <<END > /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
$M1IP  ${PREFIX}m01  ${PREFIX}m01${SUFFIX}
$W1IP  ${PREFIX}w01  ${PREFIX}w01${SUFFIX}
$W2IP  ${PREFIX}w02  ${PREFIX}w02${SUFFIX}
$W3IP  ${PREFIX}w03  ${PREFIX}w03${SUFFIX}
END
```
> Note : the dns suffix name used here is .ibm.ws could not be change for this lab.

```bash
more /etc/hosts
```

Check the results (as an example):

```bash
# more /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
158.176.122.50  niceehnbm01  niceehnbm01.ibm.ws
158.176.122.11  niceehnbw01  niceehnbw01.ibm.ws
158.176.83.198  niceehnbw02  niceehnbw02.ibm.ws
158.176.122.38  niceehnbw03  niceehnbw03.ibm.ws
```



#Task 3: Install Docker on the master node

First, you need to create a file that will be used to install Docker on the master (a file containing docker installation **icp-docker-18.09.7_x86_64.bin** has been already uploaded on your master). 

Docker has been **already installed** from Docker Hub (version 18.09.7 is required).

This following command show the version installed on the master:

``` bash
docker version
```

Results

```bash
# docker version
Client:
 Version:           18.09.7
 API version:       1.39
 Go version:        go1.10.8
 Git commit:        2d0083d
 Built:             Thu Jun 27 17:56:06 2019
 OS/Arch:           linux/amd64
 Experimental:      false

Server: Docker Engine - Community
 Engine:
  Version:          18.09.7
  API version:      1.39 (minimum version 1.12)
  Go version:       go1.10.8
  Git commit:       2d0083d
  Built:            Thu Jun 27 17:26:28 2019
  OS/Arch:          linux/amd64
  Experimental:     false

```

You can jump to the next task. 

Find below the commands to install Docker in case:

> **Don't execute these commands** :
>
> yum -y -d1 -q install http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/extras/x86_64/Packages/container-selinux-2.107-1.el7_6.noarch.rpm
> chmod +x icp-docker-18.09.7_x86_64.bin
> ./icp-docker-18.09.7_x86_64.bin --install
> systemctl start docker
> systemctl enable docker 



#Task 4: Download ICP installation code

You can get the ICP zip file into the Passport Advantage IBM web site.

However, in your **/root** directory, we already copied this zip file (**ibm-cloud-private-x86_64-3.2.1.2008.tar.gz**) for you.

```
cd
ls -al
```

Results:

```bash
# cd
# ls -al
total 13046976
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root        4096 Mar 22 04:33 .
drwxr-xr-x. 8 root root        4096 Mar 22 05:17 ..
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 10697215684 Jul 7 18:41 ibm-cloud-private-x86_64-3.2.1.2008.tar.gz
...
```

It is necessary to load the images (from this zip file) into Docker. We already **have done a pre-load** for all these images (it generally lasts 20 minutes).  

> **Don't** execute those commands (I put these commands just to undestand the process)
>
> cd
> tar xf ibm-cloud-private-x86_64-3.2.1.2008.tar.gz -O | docker load
>
> This unzips and loads docker images locally on Docker in the master. 



#Task 5: Create ssh keys

On the master, we need to generate ssh keys that we will copy across the cluster for **secure communications**. 

**Execute** the following commands:

```bash
cd
mkdir /opt/icp
cd /opt/icp
docker run -v $(pwd):/data -e LICENSE=accept ibmcom/icp-inception-amd64:3.2.1.2008-ee cp -r cluster /data

ssh-keygen -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -N ""
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | tee -a ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
systemctl restart sshd
rm -f /opt/icp/cluster/ssh_key
\cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa /opt/icp/cluster/ssh_key
ls -l /opt/icp/cluster/ssh_key

```

> The result : id_rsa key is copied in the cluster directory.
>
> Important: answer **yes** if the key already exists otherwise this will result into the following error during the installation later on:

 ![image-20200923183714340](images/image-20200923183714340-0879034.png)

Check the results:

```bash
# ls -al /opt/icp/cluster/ssh_key
-rw-------. 1 root root 3243 Sep 24 13:59 /opt/icp/cluster/ssh_key
```

**Move** the ICP zip file and some files into a specific location (this is important otherwise, you get an error during installation - Unable to find offline package):

```bash
cd /opt/icp
mkdir -p cluster/images
mv /root/ibm-cloud-private-x86_64-3.2.1.2008.tar.gz  cluster/images/
mv /root/icp-docker-18.09.7_x86_64.bin cluster/images/
```



### Distribute ssh keys on the other nodes

**Execute**  those commands to **distribute** the keys to all nodes and restart **sshd** on all nodes (these commands use sshpass that will type the pasword when requested):

```bash
cd /root/.ssh

tr ':@' '\n' < credentials | xargs -L3 sh -c 'sshpass -p $1 ssh-copy-id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -f $0@$2'
tr ':@' '\n' < credentials | xargs -L3 sh -c 'ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no $0@$2 systemctl restart sshd'
```

After this step, we will no longer need passwords to access worker nodes.



### Copy /etc/hosts on all nodes

**Execute** this command to copy remotely /etc/hosts on all worker nodes:

```bash
tr ':@' '\n' < credentials | xargs -L3 sh -c 'scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no /etc/hosts $0@$2:/etc/hosts'
```

Then we will use hostnames to get access to worker nodes instead of IP addresses.



# Task 6: Configure ICP Installation

**Execute** this code to define the ICP topology (one master and 3 workers). The management, the proxy and the VA (Vulnerability) are hosted in the master node:

```bash
cd /root
cat <<END > /opt/icp/cluster/hosts
[master]
$M1IP
[worker]
$W1IP
$W2IP
$W3IP
[proxy]
$M1IP
[management]
$M1IP
[va]
$M1IP
END
```

Configure the **config.yaml** file. To do so, **Execute** the following commands:

```bash
cd /opt/icp/cluster
sed -i "s/# cluster_name: mycluster/cluster_name: $CLUSTERNAME/g" /opt/icp/cluster/config.yaml
sed -i 's/  vulnerability-advisor: disabled/  vulnerability-advisor: disabled/g' /opt/icp/cluster/config.yaml
sed -i "s/# default_admin_password:/default_admin_password: $CLUSTERPASS/g" /opt/icp/cluster/config.yaml
sed -i 's/# install_docker: true/install_docker: true/g' /opt/icp/cluster/config.yaml
echo "password_rules:" >> /opt/icp/cluster/config.yaml
echo "- '(.*)'" >> /opt/icp/cluster/config.yaml
```

> Note: These commands will configure config.yaml file to change the following:
>
> - cluster name is set
> - VA (Vulnerability Advisor) will be installed in the master node
> - Admin password is set 
> - Docker will be installed automatically on the worker nodes
> - Password rule is set to anything (New and important !)



To understand the installation setup, you can look at the **config.yaml** file where you have all the parameters:

```bash
nano /opt/icp/cluster/config.yaml
```

Review some options (**but don't change any parameters**) :

#Task 7: Install ICP Enterprise Edition

Type the following command to install ICP Cluster on the 4 nodes:

```console
cd /opt/icp/cluster
docker run --net=host -t -e LICENSE=accept -v "$(pwd)":/installer/cluster ibmcom/icp-inception-amd64:3.2.1.2008-ee install
```
> Note : the installation should take **50 minutes**. So, if you don't see any error during the first 5 minutes, take another coffee or go to lunch. 



At the end of the ICP installation, you will get the following results:

![image-20190322164525638](images/image-20190322164525638-3269525.png)

Take a note of the URL : `https://<masterip>:8443`

> **Important Note** : in case of error, you can either **retry** the installation command **or** you can use the **uninstall** process (it takes generally 2 minutes) :

```console 
cd /opt/icp/cluster
docker run --net=host -t -e LICENSE=accept -v "$(pwd)":/installer/cluster ibmcom/icp-inception-amd64:3.2.1-ee uninstall
```

Check your connection to the master by using the URL

![image-20190322165536752](images/image-20190322165536752-3270136.png)

# Task 8: CLI installations

**kubectl** has been already installed on the master node :

```bash
kubectl
```

Results:

 ```bash
# kubectl
kubectl controls the Kubernetes cluster manager. 

Find more information at: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/

Basic Commands (Beginner):
  create         Create a resource from a file or from stdin.
  expose         Take a replication controller, service, deployment or pod and expose it as a new Kubernetes Service
  run            Run a particular image on the cluster
  set            Set specific features on objects

Basic Commands (Intermediate) ...
 ```

 

**cloudctl** CLI command should have been also installed. 

```bash
cloudctl
```

Results:

```bash
# cloudctl

```

> cloudctl command is a usefull command to modify the infrastructure level of the cluster (like adding a new node or load helm repo). 



Use the **cloudctl** command to login to the cluster (prerequisites before you install helm):

```bash
cloudctl login -a https://$CLUSTERNAME.icp:8443 --skip-ssl-validation -u admin -p $CLUSTERPASS -n default
```

Results (as an example):

```bash
# cloudctl login -a https://mycluster.icp:8443 --skip-ssl-validation -u admin -p admin1! -n default

# docker login $CLUSTERNAME.icp:8500 -u admin -p $CLUSTERPASS
WARNING! Using --password via the CLI is insecure. Use --password-stdin.
WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in /root/.docker/config.json.
Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store

Login Succeeded
```



Now modify your **.bashrc** file so that when you login again, you will be connected to the cluster:

```bash
cd
cat <<END >>.bashrc
export HELM_HOME=/root/.helm
cloudctl login -a https://$CLUSTERNAME.icp:8443 --skip-ssl-validation -u admin -p $CLUSTERPASS -n default
helm version --tls
docker login $CLUSTERNAME.icp:8500 -u admin -p $CLUSTERPASS
END
source .bashrc
```



**Persistent volumes** : for our first installation, we need to have some basic hostpath volumes.

> Note that hostpath volumes will not be used in a HA production environment. 

 Type the following commands:

```bash
cd /var
mkdir data01

cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: hostpath-pv-once-test1
spec:

# Task 9: Using the IBM Cloud Private UI

Type the following URL in your browser:

```http
https://<masterip>:8443
```



Go to the **menu** (top left), click on **Dashboard**

![image-20190322172231724](images/image-20190322172231724-3271751.png)

Check the number of nodes (4), around 48% of available storage and the 0 unhealthy pods.

Go to the **menu** (top left), click on **Platform** then on **Storage**:

![image-20190322172456003](images/image-20190322172456003-3271896.png)

At this point you should see your 2 new Hostpath Persistent storage.

Click on the **Catalog** menu (top right) to look at the list of applications already installed.

The Catalog shows Charts that you can visit (it could take au few seconds to refresh the first time)

You can look at the (helm) catalog and visit some entries (but don't create any application at the moment).
