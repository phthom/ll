# LDAP Lab

The purpose of this lab is to quickly demonstrate how to install and connect Open LDAP to IBM Cloud Private to control access of all the different kinds of administrator. 

We cover 5 steps :
- Check helm
- Installing Open LDAP thru a helm chart in ICP
- Configure and connect the created LDAP to ICP Authentication components
- Create a team with specific user IDs and roles
- Connect with one of the user IDs and test your authorizations


> **Prerequisites** : you should be logged on your master VM and connected to your ICP console.

# Task 1: Check helm

We are about to install Open LDAP thru a helm package. 
Before starting this step, we should have a valid helm configuration. 
Here are some steps you need to flow to check helm : 

`helm version --tls --short`

Results should be :

```bash
# helm version --tls --short
Client: v2.12.3+geecf22f
Server: v2.12.3+icp+g34e12ad
```

**If you didn't get this valid answer, then use `cloudctl login`.**

Another important prerequisite is Git.

`yum -y install git`

Results (as an example):

```bash
...
Installed:
  git.x86_64 0:1.8.3.1-20.el7                                                                                                                   
```





# Task 2: Install Open LDAP

Get the source code of the helm chart for Open LDAP that we are going to install our cluster. 

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/icp-openldap.git icp-openldap
```
> Note : don't change the name of the directory (**icp-openldap**) created 

Results:

```bash
# git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/icp-openldap.git icp-openldap
Cloning into 'icp-openldap'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 21, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (21/21), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (13/13), done.
remote: Total 41 (delta 8), reused 16 (delta 8), pack-reused 20
Unpacking objects: 100% (41/41), done.
```



A new directory **icp-openldap** is created.

Package the helm chart using the helm cli:

`helm package icp-openldap`

Results:
```bash
# helm package icp-openldap
Successfully packaged chart and saved it to: /root/icp-openldap-0.1.5.tgz
```

If you have not, log in to your cluster from the IBM Cloud Private CLI and log in to the Docker private image registry. 

`docker login $CLUSTERNAME.icp:8500 -u admin -p $CLUSTERPASS`

Results:

```bash
# docker login $CLUSTERNAME.icp:8500 -u admin -p $CLUSTERPASS
WARNING! Using --password via the CLI is insecure. Use --password-stdin.
WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in /root/.docker/config.json.
Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store

Login Succeeded
```

Populate the Helm chart in the IBM Cloud Private catalog :

```
cloudctl catalog load-chart --archive /root/icp-openldap-0.1.5.tgz 
```

Results:
```bash
# cloudctl catalog load-chart --archive /root/icp-openldap-0.1.5.tgz 
Loading Helm chart
Loaded Helm chart

Synch charts on repo: local-charts
OK
```

Before we can use this archive to create a LDAP instance, we need to be sure that we will not have any security issue. In IBM Cloud Private solution, IBM has implemented the **Cluster Image Policy**.

For each image in a repository, an image policy scope of either `cluster` or `namespace` is applied. When you deploy an application, IBM Container Image Security Enforcement checks whether the Kubernetes namespace that you are deploying to has any policy regulations that must be applied. If a `namespace`policy does not exist, then the `cluster` policy is applied. If neither a `cluster` or `namespace` scope policy exist, your deployment fails to launch.

By default this feature is **active** and we need to authorize the images that we want to load in a pod.

A new cluster image policy can be created with the necessary image repositories by using the following command (copy and paste all the lines):

```bash
kubectl create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: securityenforcement.admission.cloud.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: ClusterImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: ldap-cluster-image-policy
spec:
  repositories:
  - name: docker.io/osixia*
EOF
```

Result:

```bash
clusterimagepolicy.securityenforcement.admission.cloud.ibm.com/ldap-cluster-image-policy created
```

Login to ICP console.

Go to the Catalog.

Type **open** in the search zone to retrieve **icp-openldap** package.

![image-20190322220755064](images/image-20190322220755064-3288875.png)

Click on **icp-openldap** and **Configure** to see the parameters.
Add a release name **openldap**, on **local-cluster** and the **default** namespace. 

![image-20190708094449032](images/image-20190708094449032-2571889.png)

Click **Install**. Then Click **View Helm Releases**.

![ldapcheck](./images/ldapcheck.png)

> Note : The Available Column should be **1**.

Take a note of the **ClusterIP** for a future use:

![ldapclusterip](./images/ldapclusterip.png)

To get access to the Open LDAP portal, use the following URL (where the ip address is the master VM ip address):

`http://<masterip>:31080`



![ldaplogin](./images/ldaplogin.png)

Click on Login and type the following credentials :
user:
`cn=admin,dc=local,dc=io` 
password:
`admin`

You should see the following page (expand the tree on the left)

![ldaplogin2](./images/ldaplogin2.png)

> Note : 4 users have been pre-populated.

See below the **user1**:
![ldapuser](./images/ldapuser.png)



# Task3: Connect Open LDAP to ICP

Now we need to connect our newly created Open LDAP to ICP Authentication Component.
To do so, from the ICP console, Navigate to **Manage > Identity and Access > Authentication**: 

![image-20190322221858594](images/image-20190322221858594-3289538.png)

Click on the **Create the connection** link.

Then enter some details:

**LDAP Connection**
- Name: ldap
- Type: Custom

![image-20181128223357837](images/image-20181128223357837.png)



**LDAP authentication**

- Base DN: `dc=local,dc=io` (default value, adjust as needed)
- Bind DN: `cn=admin,dc=local,dc=io` (default value, adjust as needed)
- Admin Password: `admin` (default value, adjust as needed)

![image-20181128223524373](images/image-20181128223524373.png)



**LDAP URL**

- URL: `ldap://<clusterip>:389` (use the IP address we collected in task2)

![image-20181128223746848](images/image-20181128223746848.png)



Click on **Test Connection** button to check the connection. You should get a green tick.

![image-20181128223911365](images/image-20181128223911365.png)

Then modify the filters:

**LDAP Filters**

- Group filter: `(&(cn=%v)(objectclass=groupOfUniqueNames))`
- User filter: `(&(uid=%v)(objectclass=person))`
- Group ID map: `*:cn`
- User ID map: `*:uid`
- Group member ID map: `groupOfUniqueNames:uniquemember`

![image-20181128224115403](images/image-20181128224115403.png)

Then Click on **Create**. If no error, then the following list should appear:

![image-20181128224253429](images/image-20181128224253429.png)



Our new Open LDAP is now connected to the ICP Cluster.

# Task4: Create a Team

From the ICP console, Navigate to **Menu > Manage >  Identity and Access > Teams** and click on the link **Create a Team**:

![ldapteams](./images/ldapteams.png)

Enter a team name : **myteam**
Click on the **users** button. Enter **user** in the search field. **Press enter**.

Check all 4 users to be part of the team. Then choose some **roles** as shown below.

![image-20190708095926808](images/image-20190708095926808-2572766.png)

Click **Create**

![ldapteams](./images/ldapteams3.png)

Now our team is ready to support login in ICP. 

# Task5: Check Roles

**Log out** from the ICP Console.

**Log in ** again to the ICP Console with the Cluster Admin role :
User ID : `user1`
Password : `ChangeMe`

Check some menu (we should have complete access to all menus)

**Log out** from the ICP Console.

**Log in ** again to the ICP Console with the viewer role :
User ID : `user4`
Password : `ChangeMe`

Check the Image Container menu and you should receive:

![image-20181128225554063](images/image-20181128225554063.png)

If you are interested in the different roles, look at the following link:

https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.2.0/user_management/assign_role.html

# Congratulations 

You have successfully installed, deployed an **OpenLDAP** solution using helm and then you have customized the LDAP connection to ICP. Finally you successfully customized different roles for different users in one team in an **IBM Cloud Private** cluster.
